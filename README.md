# Greedy-algos_Maximum-Number-of-Prizes
You are organizing a funny competition for children. As a prize fund you have 𝑛 candies. You would like to use these candies for top 𝑘 places in a competition with a natural restriction that a higher place gets a larger number of candies. To make as many children happy as possible, you are going to find the largest value of 𝑘 for which it is possible. Problem Description Task. The goal of this problem is to represent a given positive integer 𝑛 as a sum of as many pairwise distinct positive integers as possible. That is, to find the maximum 𝑘 such that 𝑛 can be written as 𝑎1 + 𝑎2 + · · · + 𝑎𝑘 where 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑘 are positive integers and 𝑎𝑖 ̸= 𝑎𝑗 for all 1 ≤ 𝑖 &lt; 𝑗 ≤ 𝑘.
